## Project Structure

* `main.tex`: The main research paper document, written in LaTeX. It integrates various components like figures, references, and supplementary content.
* `supplementary_content.tex`: Detailed theoretical background, methodology, and additional results supporting the main paper. This LaTeX file is included as an appendix in `main.tex`.
* `references.bib`: BibTeX file containing all bibliographic references cited throughout the thesis. It includes detailed entries for academic papers, books, and other sources.
* `pseudo_entropy.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the core code for simulating pseudo-entropy calculations and generating the main results presented in the paper. This notebook relies on the data generated by `hardware-data.ipynb` for noise models and thresholds.
* `hardware-data.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook designed to interact with and extract data from IBM's Qiskit simulators. It generates hardware-related data files, which then populate the `hardware/` directory and are crucial for calibrating noise models and thresholds used in `pseudo_entropy.ipynb`.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies required to run the Jupyter notebooks, ensuring a consistent environment.
* `results/`: This directory contains all generated figures (e.g., sensitivity maps, phase diagrams) and various data tables in Excel (`.xlsx`) format derived from the simulations and analysis.
* `hardware/`: This directory contains hardware-related data, specifically `hardware.csv` (simulated qubit characteristics) and `optimal_qubit_groups.csv` (optimized qubit group configurations), both of which are outputs generated by `hardware-data.ipynb`.
* `data/`: This directory stores intermediate and final processed data in `.pkl` (Python pickle) format. Running `pseudo_entropy.ipynb` with existing `.pkl` files in this directory will cause the notebook to use these pre-calculated values instead of re-running computationally intensive steps, saving computation time.

## Supplementary Figures, Data, and Code Guide

This repository provides all figures, data tables, and code supporting the research article “Enhanced Coherent Error Detection in Quantum Computing.”
**All captions include succinct scientific interpretations, and critical transition boundaries—most notably $\beta = \pm\pi/2$—are stated explicitly.**

### 1. Pseudo-Entropy Sensitivity Maps and Critical Lines

> **Key Concept:** The detection protocol’s main innovation is the use of the imaginary part of pseudo-entropy $\Im\check{S}$ to reveal *coherent* (non-stochastic) error regimes.
> **Critical transition lines**, particularly $\beta = \pm\pi/2$, are explicitly annotated, as they mark the boundary between classical-like and quantum-like circuit behavior.

#### Main Sensitivity and Gradient Figures

| Figure (Path) | Description & Scientific Context | Critical Features |
| :------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **results/d_abs_imag_pseudo_entropy_d_beta.png** | **Gradient of abs(Im(pseudo-entropy)) w.r.t. β**: Shows the sensitivity (gradient) of the absolute imaginary component of pseudo-entropy (`abs(Im(pseudo-entropy))`) with respect to the interaction strength (β) across the parameter space. Identifies regions where `abs(Im(pseudo-entropy))` changes most rapidly with β, highlighting its responsiveness to variations in entanglement dynamics. | **Peaks at β = ±π/2**: These mark the main transition zones between classical-like and quantum-like behavior. |
| **results/d_abs_imag_pseudo_entropy_d_delta.png** | **Gradient of abs(Im(pseudo-entropy)) w.r.t. δ**: Displays the sensitivity (gradient) of the absolute imaginary component of pseudo-entropy (`abs(Im(pseudo-entropy))`) with respect to the coherent error angle (δ) across the parameter space. Pinpoints regions where `abs(Im(pseudo-entropy))` is most sensitive to coherent errors, underscoring its utility as a diagnostic metric. | Maxima cluster near β = ±π/2 and specific δ values, indicating heightened sensitivity in these regions. |
| **results/d_abs_real_pseudo_entropy_d_beta.png** | **Gradient of abs(Re(pseudo-entropy)) w.r.t. β**: Illustrates the sensitivity (gradient) of the absolute real component of pseudo-entropy (`abs(Re(pseudo-entropy))`) with respect to the interaction strength (β). Variations here are minimal, underscoring the diagnostic value of the imaginary part for coherent error detection. | No significant transition or sharp features are observed at β = ±π/2, reaffirming the focus on Im(pseudo-entropy). |
| **results/d_abs_real_pseudo_entropy_d_delta.png** | **Gradient of abs(Re(pseudo-entropy)) w.r.t. δ**: Further shows the sensitivity (gradient) of the absolute real component of pseudo-entropy (`abs(Re(pseudo-entropy))`) with respect to the coherent error angle (δ). Its insensitivity reinforces the focus on Im(pseudo-entropy) for coherent error detection. | Absence of sharp features or critical transitions at β = ±π/2, confirming the real part's stability. |
| **results/variables_sensitivity.png** | **Global sensitivity map**: Provides an overall view of how both the real and imaginary components of pseudo-entropy change with respect to both β and δ. Offers a comparative view of how significantly pseudo-entropy responds to each parameter, guiding the focus of error detection efforts. | The peak sensitivity of Im(pseudo-entropy) at β = ±π/2 is distinctly pronounced, highlighting its diagnostic importance. |

### 2. Phase Diagrams, Model Comparisons, and Segment Analysis

* **Phase Diagrams:** (located as `results/classical_vs_quantum_regions_thresh_X.png`, `results/continuous_classical_regions_thresh_X.png`)
    * Show delineation of classical-like vs quantum-like behavior by thresholding $\Im\check{S}$.
    * **Critical boundary:** Always marked or interpreted at $\beta = \pm\pi/2$.
* **Model vs Simulation:** (e.g. `results/theory_vs_simulation_cartesian.png`, `results/theory_vs_simulation_polar.png`)
    * Direct overlays confirm analytical and numerical consistency of the pseudo-entropy model against simulation results.
* **Segment Analysis:** (`results/segments.xlsx`)
    * Contains detection rates and segment boundaries across thresholds; matches up with figures in main text, validating the region and threshold claims.
